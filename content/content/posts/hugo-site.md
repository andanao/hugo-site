## Background {#background}

My old personal site was built on Jekyll back in university, once I started working I never updated it.  Now that I'm using EMACS for everything in my life I want a way that I can easily share my thoughts with the world and have something public facing that is easy to keep updated.  I'm aware that there are packages for Jekyll and EMACS but I want to start from a clean slate.  There seems to be plenty of support for Hugo in EMACS with [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/).

This page is intended to be a living document documenting my process and keeping track of some helpful links as I work throught the process of building this site.


## Resources {#resources}

My main intent with this site is to share most of my `.org` files that aren't deemed too personal and to publish them here.
